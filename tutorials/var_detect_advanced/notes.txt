Khalid/Simon/Sehrish/Nuwan:
- basic used hg19? any reason not to use hg38?
- hg19 works with GATK?

TBD: I think we should do DoC across genes or exons!

!? samtoolsVersion=1.2+htslib-1.2.1

phased snv example at ~1089360

TBD: slides

Overview
Background - done (3)
Preparation - done (5)
1 QC - (ok) done (5)
2 Alignment and DoC (15) - done?
    - alignment ok but need to switch to bowtie2 for gatk to work - done
    - need to check igv - ok
    - bed ok,
    - gatk DoC working but maybe replace with bedtools - and done
    - would it be better to use picard-style readgroup?
3 mpileup
    - output looks dodgy
    - totally broken in samtools 1.2; remove for now
4 local realignment
    - totally broken. try with other aligners as per simon's tests
    - check if before and after shows interesting effect
5 Freebayes
    - working - polish instructions and check igv output
    - abandoned complicated settings in favour of presets
    - looks not so promiscous any more...

TBD: add in VCF section

6 UnifiedGenotyper or haplotypecaller
   - needs testing
7 Evaluate variants (also gatk, but could use bedtools again)
8 Annotation
    - VEP not owrking so have to rewrite this section completely
    - snpeff works IF use named on demand, and either vcf or bed selected
    - MAYBE also try downloading a vcf file of annotations and intersecting them???
?9 Filtering (or merge in with annotation)
   - IF we can find a tool to etiher produce tabular annotations, or to filter reliably on INFO comma-and-pipe separated fields. Otherwise just include a tiny filter by keyword in section 8



## FreeBayes:

TBD: check filtering setting in Galaxy; just reads, or also variants?

TBD: freebayes is probably not a lot less conservative than other tools at this point, so rewrite text

TBD: check whether we use realigned BAM file here

TBD: find a variant in freebayes not in other caller?? or later? or at all??

Testing bed-restricted, basic bam, "simple diploid": 4240 lines, look reasonable
Testing bed-restricted, basic bam, "simple diploid with filtering and coverage": 3551 lines
Testing bed-restricted, basic bam, custom options: set allele scope, ignore indel alleles: 3807 lines

## Realignment:

TBD: add/check examples

* Possible site of interest at 1094320
* or 1080728
* maybe more exciting at 1076782

maybe call indels?

## UnifiedGenotyper

MAYBE replace with HaplotypeCaller

maybe call indels?

TBD: test comparative region.

TBD: We now have three different variant call sets from the same data. Browse around in IGV looking at places where they are different: eg look at: chr20:1,127,767-1,127,906
Here each of the variant callers has given a different SNP call. This is a confusing region for SNP callers due to the 15bp deletion, which may or may not be on both alleles.
We could immediately improve the FreeBayes callset by filtering on variant quality scores. If you want, you can do this with the NGS: GATK>Select Variants tool, choose the FreeBayes vcf file, click ‘Add new criteria to use when selecting data.’, use ‘QUAL>50’, Execute)

## Variant evaluation

Note that the Ti/Tv for all callsets is around 2.3 for the dbSNP concordant variants, but varies widely for the novel variants (Mpileup:2.32; FreeBayes: 2.25; GATK: 2.26). This is as expected, as these are almost certainly true variant sites.
The Ti/Tv ratio for the Mpileup callset (input_0) looks pretty convincing: it’s 2.32 for all variants, 2.32 for the dbSNP (what we consider very likely to be true variants) and 2.32 for the novel variants. This is a very convincing set of numbers, but it’s worth noting that Mpileup called the fewest number of variants. FreeBayes, which called the most variants, has a Ti/Tv ratio for novel variants that looks very much like random noise - a Ti/Tv of 1 is what you would expect from variants with overall random base changes, which is not what we expect to see.
It is of course easy to call the highly confident variants, the trick is in calling ALL the variants, including ones on the margin of false positive/false negative.
So although we have a lot of confidence in the set of variants called by Mpileup, we might want to assure ourselves that this callset is exhaustive and we don’t have a high false negative rate. THIS is very hard to do!

## Annotation

Add galaxy-tut ref data caveat
